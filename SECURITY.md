# Security Policy

Maplyo Core takes security seriously. If you believe you have found a vulnerability, please follow the process below so we can investigate and ship a fix quickly.

## Reporting a vulnerability
- Email security@maplyo.dev (placeholder – replace with your real security contact) with detailed reproduction steps, affected versions/commits, and any proof-of-concept material.
- Please do not open a public GitHub issue for sensitive reports. Issues are appropriate only after a fix has shipped.

## Response expectations
- We operate on a best-effort basis. You should receive an acknowledgement within 5 business days, though most reports receive an earlier response.
- After triage, we will keep you updated about remediation progress and expected timelines.
- If the report is accepted, we will coordinate a disclosure date that balances remediation with transparency.

## Disclosure guidelines
- Please refrain from publicly disclosing the issue until a fix is released and we jointly agree that disclosure is safe for the community.
- When possible we will credit reporters in release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
- If you discover that an already public issue poses a security risk, contact us immediately so we can triage and update existing threads with guidance.

Thank you for helping keep Maplyo Core users safe.
