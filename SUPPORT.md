# Support

## Community support
- **GitHub Issues**: Use for reproducible bugs, security-safe questions, or small feature requests related to the AGPL core.
- **GitHub Discussions**: Use for troubleshooting help, roadmap brainstorming, or implementation advice that benefits other community members.
- **Pull Requests**: Best channel for contributing fixes or documentation updates you have already implemented.

Response times are best-effort and depend on maintainer availability. Search existing threads before opening a new one to keep noise low.

## Paid support and commercial extensions
Commercial support, SLAs, and proprietary extensions are offered separately from this repository. If you are interested in advanced deployment guidance or premium features, please contact the Maplyo team through your commercial channel. These services are closed-source and do not live in this repository.
