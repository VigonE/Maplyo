# Project Governance

## Leadership model
Maplyo Core follows a BDFL-style governance model. Arnaud Loulier serves as the lead maintainer with final say over roadmap priorities, architectural direction, and release readiness. The lead maintainer may delegate tasks but retains veto power to keep the project cohesive.

## Decision making
- Day-to-day decisions (bug fixes, routine maintenance) are made by the contributor who proposes the change and the reviewing maintainer, following the process in CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Significant decisions (new modules, backwards-incompatible changes, licensing updates) require explicit approval from Arnaud Loulier. These proposals should be discussed in GitHub Issues or Discussions with clear motivation and impact analysis.
- In the event of conflicting proposals, the maintainers will seek consensus. If consensus cannot be reached, the lead maintainer’s decision is final.

## Becoming a maintainer
- Demonstrate sustained, high-quality contributions across code, documentation, and community support.
- Show ownership by shepherding features from design through release and participating in reviews.
- Be willing to enforce the Code of Conduct and uphold the security and licensing policies.

New maintainers are nominated by existing maintainers and confirmed by Arnaud Loulier. Maintainer status can be paused or revoked if the responsibilities above are not being met or if Code of Conduct violations occur.
